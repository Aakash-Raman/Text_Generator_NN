# Text_Generator_NN
In this Text Generator Project, We show the model many training examples ("Frankenstein.txt") so it can learn a patter between the input and the output. Each input is a sequence of characters and the output is a missing character (For ex: I/p: "You are grea" o/p: "You are great"). Altering the Epoch value trains the model better and provides better results!!
